 • Tea. Teabags or loose leaf teas will work. Sometimes common, low-grade teas will end up tasting better than expensive teas. Teas containing oils, like bergamot oils in Earl Grey, can harm your mushroom, meaning significantly longer brewing times for satisfactory results. Many teas will work:
 • Green
 • Black
 • Echinacea
 • Lemon balm
 • Sugar sources. Regular refined white sugar or organic cane sugar works fine. You can experiment with other fermentables, like juice reconstituted with tea. Many brewers prefer organic, if available. Ribena, for example, colours mushrooms and tea."

Make Caffe Latte Freddo," • Get the espresso beans or espresso ground. Espresso beans are a type of different coffee beans that have less acidity than other types of coffee beans. In the Italian tradition, they are always a blend of beans that in addition to being low in acidity, are heavily bodied, and sweet.
 • You can buy a bag of your favorite espresso roast at any coffee shop or grocery store. If you don’t know a lot about different roasts, then just look for “Espresso Roast” on the bag.
 • If you get whole beans then you will have to grind them properly for espresso, which is a fine grind.
 • You can substitute the espresso for strong coffee if you need, and add just a bit of sugar to mimic the sweetness of espresso.
 • Grab some milk. You will need about 3/4 a cup of milk for every cup of espresso. You don’t have to worry about frothing the milk for a Caffe Latte Freddo. Unlike the lattes you usually get at a coffee shop here, this drink has you just mixing the milk into the espresso and shaking.
 • Whole milk is the standard in Italy, but you can use whichever milk you prefer.
 • Thinner milks will affect how thick your drink ends up being.
 • Get 8 to 10 ice cubes. Your ice cubes shouldn’t be too large as the method for making the Caffe Latte Freddo involves shaking instead of blending.
 • Regular ice cube trays should be fine.
 • Grab a tablespoon of sugar. If you want your drink to taste a bit less bitter you can add sugar to your drink. While espresso roasts are sweeter than other roasts, some people still prefer an even sweeter taste."

Accept Christ As Your Savior," • The Bible: In some countries there are few Bibles, and there is persecution of Christians -- or lack of funds and supply. The word of God, especially the Book of John in the Bible, tells how to be a Christian. Owning a Bible isn't -- but access to the Bible is -- essential.
 • Other Christians to encourage and guide you. If you don't know any, praise God for the mission field that He has placed you in! You may feel inexperienced, but read the Bible and ask God what He wants. Do those things, but verify that it is truly Him by comparing the plan with His word (the Bible)."

Make Kombucha Tea," • A fermentation/incubation container.  It is recommended that this container be made of food-grade glass. Use of other materials (i.e. ceramic, metal, and/or plastic) may leach chemicals (including lead if using ceramic) into the ferment due to the natural acidic generation within the kombucha fermentation process. Some have claimed good success with stainless steel and food-grade plastic, but glass is preferred. Anywhere between a quart to a gallon should be a good starting point. Most people start with 1oz per day, as the digestive tract may need some time to get used to the kombucha. The volume of the container thereafter should be based on the rate at which you will be consuming the beverage, as well as the available area in which you can let the ferment sit. Brewing equipment, such as 5-gallon carboys for brewing beer or wine will work very well.
 • A lint-free, tightly woven cloth (such as a clean T-shirt). This will be used to cover the fermentation container to keep insects, particularly fruit flies, dust, and other foreign particulates from contaminating the culture while allowing the microorganisms to breathe. The cloth will need to be larger than the opening area of the fermentation container.
 • A rubber band or string. The rubber band or string will be used to secure the cloth cover to the opening of the fermentation container.
 • Apple-cider vinegar for cleaning
 • A large pot for heating water and adding tea and sugar. Stainless steel works well. It should be large enough to hold the volume of fluid in the fermentation container.
 • Glass bottles with stoppers for the finished kombucha. You will need enough glass bottles to accommodate the volume of the ferment. The size of the bottles should be based on a serving portion that you prefer to drink.
 • Funnel. To transfer fermented kombucha to serving bottles.

 • A computer (depending on your level of usage for it, some people will want an incredibly fast machine, but most use their computers for general program applications and word processing) A laptop computer is highly recommended, because it allows for portability when going home and increases one's ability to type up lecture notes. Also, professors often talk incredibly fast so typing notes most definitely trumps writing them out. Plus, times new roman is probably neater than your handwriting!
 • Reliable printer + accompanying black ink cartridges (you don't really need color ink much)
 • Mini fridge (great for cooling water, juice, milk, fruit, etc.)
 • Microwave (not that important, but comes in handy once in a while.)
 • Collapsible boxes or storage bins (great for bringing things back and forth from home, and also comes in handy when you move out of your dorm at the end of the year)
 • Water! You will get incredibly thirsty in your room and should have some readily available water reserves at hand. A filter would satisfy this requirement, but some might prefer bottled spring water. Depends on what you like.
 • Snacks - Snacks are great for those late nights studying, or at times in which you have to skip a meal. Granola bars have done wonders.
 • Cold/Flu Medicine - Face it, you will get sick at least once or twice while at school, and having medicine ready will only work to your advantage!
 • Toiletries (toothpaste, mouth wash, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, scrubber, as many towels as you can bring so you don't have to do laundry as often)
 • Carrying case for toiletries (not very necessary unless your room is far from the common baths and you are not provided with some cubby space to place your items)

Furnish Your First College Dorm or Apartment on a Budget," • Kitchen
 • Utensils: You'll need knives, forks and spoons to eat with but also knives to chop with and larger spoons for stirring. You should also get bigger plastic or wooden (not metal, it scratches Teflon) spoons and spatulas to use on Teflon-coated (non-stick) pans.
 • Pots and Pans: You may not cook a lot now, but you should learn. Once you learn to cook for one you can stretch your buck a lot farther. Get non-stick (Teflon coated) pots and pans (easier to clean and food won't stick.) You'll need a skillet type pan, medium in size, a saucepan or two, a baking sheet or jellyroll pan and a round pizza pan if you can find one (and like to eat pizza). Jellyroll and baking sheets come in many sizes. Try to get a small or medium pan since the large pans (usually 17""-19"") don't always fit into small ovens.
 • Dishes: For ease, you should stock up on plastic plates (paper plates makes too much waste). It is also important to have microwave-safe dishes. Look on the bottom of the plate; it will usually be marked if it is microwave safe with ""Microwave Safe"". You'll need bowls and plates. If you drink coffee, you'll also need coffee cups.
 • Glassware: Glasses are for drinking, not for use as ashtrays or mixing bowls. Some people prefer glass over plastic. Most people have a combination of the two. Look for a heavy-feeling glass that isn't too big nor too small. Think of the glasses you drink out of daily and look for glasses that size. Glasses with stems (think wine glasses) can break easily and may not be suitable for everyday dorm/apartment use. If you find a few inexpensive ones or someone offers you free ones, you can take them, but save them for special occasions. Plastic cups should be sturdy and without odor.
 • Food storage: Storage bowls are usually plastic and come with a lid. You can find very inexpensive plastic storage containers in the grocery store. They are inexpensive enough for you throw away should they get old or nasty. Try to have 1-3 larger storage containers and at least 4-5 smaller containers. If you are living somewhere susceptible to insects, you can also get storage containers big enough to hold a box of cereal, a bag of sugar, and large enough to hold a loaf of bread.
 • Ziploc bags are great for storage. You can store the rest of a sandwich, snacks or use them to pack take-along snacks so you can stretch your budget and not eat out as much.
 • Try to pick up the inexpensive storage containers for your leftovers and everyday use. These can usually be found on the aluminium foil or Ziploc bag aisle in most grocery stores for $2-$5 for several small ones.
 • For storing sugar, flour, bread, etc. you may need a larger plastic storage container that can be found in the Rubbermaid or kitchen storage section of your local discount store. These will cost a bit more because they are heavy duty. Try to ask your family if they have extras before you buy.
 • Mixing: You may not do a lot of mixing, but having 1-2 bowls around isn't a bad thing. Some even come with lids so you can have backup storage if you need it. Stainless steel bowls are inexpensive and will literally last a lifetime if you maintain them.
 • Look for a few cookbooks if you like to cook. There are cookbooks dedicated to cooking for singles, on budgets and easy meals. Don't forget to add measuring cups and spoons to your shopping list since you'll need more precise measuring with cookbook recipes.
 • Gadgets and small appliances:
 • Microwave- try to get a smaller one since space will be a premium (unless you get a great deal on a large one).
 • Can opener- these come in electric and manual. If you open lots of cans you can think about an electric.
 • Toaster or toaster oven- can save electricity if you use it instead of an oven for small items.
 • Coffee maker- look for something with a simple carafe. The replacements can be found easily if broken. You can also use coffee makers for making tea or just heating water.
 • Blender- great for making shakes and smoothies. The lid is essential.
 • Hot Air Popcorn Popper- This is a fantastic item, and if you can find a cheap working one, you should get it. Popcorn is easy to fix, super cheap and a great snack to offer friends that won't hurt your wallet. With the hot air poppers you can prepare it in 3 minutes and have minimal cleanup.
 • Towels and linens: You'll need at least two sets of sheets for your bed, a blanket or comforter (more or less depending on where you live), wash cloths, bath towels, kitchen towels, oven mitts, cleaning rags and/or sponges. Cool colors are fun but staying with whites will give you the option to bleach if things get really dirty or smelly. Try to get blankets and comforters that are machine washable and can actually fit into a washing machine. Don't forget linens and pillows. Sleeping on a mattress with no mattress pad or sheets can be unsanitary, promote dust mite infestation and shorten the life of the item.
 • Cleaning: No one likes to clean so make the job easier with the proper tools. Get a mop, bucket, broom, dustpan, rags, sponges, an all purpose cleaner like 409 or Fantastic that will clean or degrease, ammonia is also great for cleaning everything from appliances to windows, bathroom cleaner, toilet bowl cleaner and toilet bowl brush, (if you have carpet you'll need a vacuum cleaner and vacuum bags). If you really hate cleaning you can pick up some yellow kitchen gloves to keep your hands from getting dirty. You should also pick up a plunger for your bathroom. They're cheap and when you need one, you need one. Sometimes super cheap dollar brand cleansers may not work as well as the name brands.
 • Furniture items: This can be picked up free from family. Ask your parents if you can take older furniture from the home or check the attic or basement for forgotten lamps and accessories. Make a list of the obvious needs: Bed, dresser, couch, chairs, etc.
 • If you can't find a table you can always use tray tables. They're cheaper and easier to move.
 • Check Craigslist, local thrift stores and put the word out to family that you need furnishings.
 • Avoid water beds or king size beds. Many places prohibit water beds and king size beds only work in very large rooms. Think functionality and take what will fit. You may need to talk to your parents about letting you take something from the guest room or trade with a sibling.
 • Use slipcovers to give old couches and chairs a new look. Slipcovers will also protect them from spills. Don't worry about finding top of the line couches and chairs. Get what you can and what will fit your space and use slip covers to tie the d•cor together.
 • Larger appliances usually come with apartments but you should ask when renting a house.
 • Washer and dryers- availability may vary from location to location so make sure you ask if these are included. If they're not included but a hook up is available you can easily find a used washer and dryer second hand. Check the yellow pages and contact buyers that buy and sell appliances. These businesses often buy broken units and refurbish them for resale. Also check the newspaper classifieds and Craigslist. Often people will unload old ones when moving or getting new ones. These are sometimes in excellent working order and are sold at a very low price because they don't want to deal with moving or hauling. (This is also how some used appliance retailers get products.) If they offer a laundry room and in-apartment hook-ups you should check the cost of their laundry room. You may easily spend more paying per load than spending $50 each on a used washer and dryer.
 • Verify the type of washer and dryer hook up that is available in an apartment before you buy. They may offer a hookup but only for an electric dryer or a stackable until.
 • Don't worry if the plug on the dryer doesn't match the receptacle in the apartment. There are two kinds of cords and plugs widely used. You can go to any home improvement or appliance store and get a new plug for about $10-$15. Following the instructions, it will take about 10 minutes to exchange the old one for the new one.
 • Air conditioners- these may or may not be a necessity where you will be living. Sometimes old houses that are rented out may not have the amenities like air conditioning. You can often find window units for sale at some of the same used appliance centers as you would find washer and dryers. Check Craigslist and your local paper for inexpensive used options. Some larger apartment buildings may rent and install these. If you're moving into a high rise this could be a low stress option.
 • Lighting. You'll need it to study and lamps can be much more cost effective than running overhead lights. Make sure you're asking family about unwanted lamps. Check yard sales and thrift stores. Be open to floor lamps, desk lamps and table lamps. Like with other hand-me-down d•cor you can often paint it black, gold or silver to match most any d•cor. Discount stores also sell replacement shades. Consider using energy efficient bulbs and make sure you aren't using a 100 watt bulb in a lamp made for a 40 watt light. It could be a fire hazard.
 • Storage options. By having storage available, you'll eliminate clutter and having things stacked around your new place. Add bookcases or storage shelves to your list. Students will have lots of books and keeping them organized can save you time and frustration. Have enough room to store the items you have. Don't forget to bring adequate storage for clothes, personal items, etc."

 • A great work surface for cutting and preparing wall covering can be created by using an inexpensive luan door which can be purchased at home improvement centers. Even if you are a ""weekend warrior"" the benefits of a good work surface will be realized in a single job. These will typically be about 30"" wide and 84"" long. They are very light. You can use over a few sawhorses or on top of an existing table - just put some scratch/paste protection like a blanket on the base table.
 • Also, no pro hangs wall covering without a good metal straight edge. Try using a 4 foot (1.2•m) metal ruler. Use this as a guide on the table to cut your wall covering lengthwise.
 • Single edge razor blades are excellent for cutting. They are very sharp and worth the time and investment to obtain. Although there are blade holders available, I get greater dexterity by simply holding the blade in hand. Buy a box of 100 and discard at about a rate of 1 per single roll of wall covering. Never ""saw"" at your wall covering. That is a sure sign your blade is dull. Why ruin a full sheet of wall covering over a 5 cent razor blade? This is one of the biggest mistakes beginners make - not using a sharp blade.
 • 12"" smoothing brush - typically with 1/2"" bristles.
 • 6"" joint knife - use this to provide a guide for trimming the wall covering against ceilings and trim. Place the blade into the joint and cut on the ceiling / trim side of the blade for a clean cut."

Hang Wallpaper," • Pasting and cutting table - a very good and inexpensive option is a lauan door that can be purchased at home improvement centers. They are usually 24""-30"" wide and 80"" long. Get the 30"" version if you can find it as it provides a little room for placing tools and you will need a 30"" board if your wall covering is 27"" wide. Avoid using counter tops or furniture as either the moisture or razor blades will ruin the surface.
 • 12"" Smoothing brush Usually with 3/4 inch (1.9•cm) bristles. Avoid the smoothing brushes with 1"" bristles or longer if you come across them. This will be used to smooth out the paper and remove bubbles.
 • 6"" Joint knife This will be used primarily to cut your wallpaper against ceilings and trim. Also, to apply spackle for wall repairs. Avoid the plastic DIY versions; they cut easily and lose a good straight cutting edge.
 • 100 ct. box of single edge razor blades - absolutely the best to cut your wall covering on the table and on the wall as you hang. Get more than 5-10, you are going to use a bunch - about 2 per single roll is about right.
 • Tape measure - a 25 feet (7.6•m). tape measure works well because of the slightly wider rule helps keep it stiff as you extend it out to measure long distances.
 • Plastic tarp for a work area, get one big enough for your table, room to stand on while cutting and pasting, and room for putting pasted paper until it is hung.
 • Adhesive appropriate for your type of wall covering.
 • 5 gallon (18.9•L) bucket - new or used. This is what we will mix our adhesive in that we will apply to the back of the paper.
 • Paint roller and frame 3/8 "" nap on the roller is best, budget roller is OK. A roller with a plastic core instead of cardboard is a bonus. This will be used for applying paste to the wall covering. If you need to prime (you better), get a second higher quality roller for priming. Extension poles are highly recommended. They will keep you on the ground instead of climbing a ladder every few feet along the wall.
 • Primer - any brand of primer will work. This will set up a good foundation for your wallpaper to stick to if your walls are painted prior to adding the paper.
 • Large non-abrasive sponges and small terry cloth towels. Sponges will be used to clean and wipe down freshly hung wallpaper and towels will be used to clean the pasting table. Don't use towels on most wall coverings as they are too abrasive and may damage the new wallpaper  surface. Adhesives are water soluble so the towels will not be ruined.
 • Ladder - For eight ft. ceilings a six ft. ladder is recommended. It is possible to hang paper with a smaller stepladder with 8 feet (2.4•m). ceilings, but you want to reach and cut above your head as little as possible. For ten ft ceilings an eight foot ladder is recommended.
 • 4 feet (1.2•m). metal ruler found at most home improvement centers. This will be used to measure and to make lengthwise cuts on the table.
 • 2 feet (0.6•m). level (a 4 ft. level can be used also). Use this to check for ""plumb"" while hanging.
 • Pencil - You will need to mark the walls you wallpaper with plumb lines, and using a pen will bleed through the paper. Use a regular HB pencil or H pencil for the best results.
 • Screwdrivers and Pliers - for removing and replacing all face plates and hardware mounted on the wall.
 • Spackle is great for small holes and rough spots. It is not strong enough to repair large holes though (bigger than a golf ball). For large holes, use a hole repair technique that will call for joint compound which dries more slowly but is stronger.
 • Sanding sponge - very handy for smoothing spackle and small bumps in painted walls.
 • Portable work light, especially for small bathrooms with little or no windows. Remember, all wall mounted light fixtures will be removed.
 • Trash bag clean up as you go."

 • Carabiner. This is to be rated and approved for climbing and supporting a human's body weight. Must have a lockable gate.
 • Leather gloves. Although this is not a lesson in climbing you must protect your hands when rappelling; there will be a lot of friction, heat, and the possibility of particles in the rope as it passes through your hands. Or, you can use a simple pair of mechanic's gloves."

Make a Desk Chair from a Car Seat," • A salvage tilting, swiveling desk chair. The condition of the seat itself does not matter, since you'll be getting rid of it: what you want is the mechanical base. You can probably acquire one of these for free, since these are discarded thoughtlessly all over the place. The important thing is that the part where the seat bolts on is made of steel. Because a car seat is fairly large and heavy, and likely to be reclined shifting your weight distribution on it, a wide, sturdy base typical of a large, reclinable chair (known as an ""manager"" or ""executive"" chair in the US) is best. A five-footed one is preferable, but not essential.
 • A car front seat. Head to your local junkyard and find something comfortable and not too worn out. Ideally, you want something from a sporty-ish car, as these tend to be much more supportive and adjustable; try before you buy to find one right for you. Our example used a seat from a Vauxhall Astra GTE; early Toyota Supra seats are also excellent. The most important thing is that the seat is entirely manual in operation; any electrical components will, of course, be useless, and may complicate dismantling the seat.
 • Look for a seat with adjustable armrests attached to the sides of the seat itself.
 • A leather-covered seat is more likely to be and easier to keep clean, but a cloth-covered one may be more comfortable because it grips you somewhat rather than just sliding you toward its lowest point.
 • A welder, or a friend who can weld for you.
 • Either:
 • A bandsaw. If you don't have one of these, the angle grinder fitted with cutting discs is fine (if less accurate).
 • An angle grinder; a small 115mm (6"") one is fine. You'll want both cutting and grinding discs for it.
Or:
 • A hacksaw, a file, and a lot of patience.
 • A drill, with a selection of bits suitable for cutting metal. A variable-speed drill is preferable.
 • Some steel box-section. You'll need roughly 5 feet (1.5•m) of this. Our example used 2.5"" x 1"" section from some old commercial shelving.
 • A small sheet of steel, about 4mm thick. Since you only need a few inches of it, chances are good that you'll be able to scavenge this from somewhere (or something) rather than buying some.
 • A steel rule or tape measure, plus a marker pen.
 • Optionally, black paint suitable for metal; smooth Hammerite is a good bet.
 • Some other basic tools like spanners (ratchet spanners are best, or a socket set), screwdrivers, hammers and so on."

 • Denman D3 Brush: This brush kills two birds with one stone. It acts as a great styling brush if you use a blow dryer or diffuser and it detangles curls too. Because the teeth are closer together than a wide tooth comb, be sure to use a generous amount of conditioner in order to lubricate your curls and prevent breakage.

Quit Drinking without Alcoholics Anonymous," • Something Else To Do. Giving yourself a distraction from your booze brain is an absolute priority!
 • Reminders. Sometimes, your booze brain will try to trick you into drinking by bringing up memories of good times, fun, parties, or anything pleasant that involved alcohol. You•ll need tools to counter this, such as a list of the reasons you quit drinking. Don't forget all the negative things that drinking has brought into your life, such as guilt, embarrassment, social isolation, legal problems, financial hardships, ruined relationships, and a host of health concerns. If your booze brain says, ""Remember that time you were drunk and..."" you can finish the thought with, ""I hurt someone close to me; I got arrested; I missed work; or I was sick for an entire day."" Remember, the perceived, temporary positives do not in any way equal the real, long-term negatives of drinking."

Load and Fire a Muzzleloader," • Flintlock muzzleloader of any caliber, smooth bored or rifled on the inside of the barrel. It would be ill-advised to attempt to shoot any ancient relics dredged up from a 16th century galleon or anything else equivalently antiquated, as the barrel may burst spectacularly when fired and severely maim or kill you, ending your illustrious career of oxygen piracy for good. Make sure that any old guns have been certified by a professional gunsmith as being safe to fire.
 • Flints made specifically for firelocks. Different sizes are available, generally the ""English Flint"" is a good type to use.
 • Small scraps of leather, to be used to clamp the flint securely in the jaws of the cock (hammer part)
 • Ramrod that hopefully came with said muzzleloader. If a ramrod is not included, as sometimes the case may be, measure the diameter of the bore (inside of the barrel) and buy a dowel or rod slightly smaller than the bore, but slightly longer than the barrel length. Treat this with some kind of wood sealer such as linseed oil so it will not absorb water and swell. Now you have a ramrod.
 • Lead balls of the same caliber (the barrel's internal diameter) as the weapon, able to roll from one end of the barrel to the other without getting stuck. You can also fire a swarm of smaller lead balls (shot) from a muzzleloader, making it an effective scattergun.
 • Black Powder. FFFF grade black powder is needed in order to prime the muzzleloader.  There are also three other grades of black powder that can be used to load the firearm: F, FF, and FFF.  Generally F is a very coarse powder used for the largest of calibers, while FF is usually the recommended choice for 50 caliber muzzleloaders.  Smaller muzzleloaders such as pistols may use FFF powder.
 • Powder horn. This is optional, but recommended if you are hunting. Keeps the powder dry and readily available.
 • Powder measure that measures in grains (g). This is absolutely necessary as even experienced shooters have blown up their guns due to loading too much powder by accident.
 • Priming dispenser. This is not required, but certainly makes it easier to prime the pan with FFFFg powder. Usually a small cylinder made of brass.
 • Ball starter. This is generally only required for rifles as the patched ball is much harder to ram down the rifled barrel than an unpatched ball in a smoothbore. Usually a wooden ball with two protuberances, one long, one short.
 • An owner's manual to the muzzleloader.  These will generally have safety guidelines, as well as recommended maximum loads for the muzzleloader.  Make sure you stay within these guidelines.  If you do not have an owner's manual for that particular muzzleloader, it is recommended that you obtain one."

Succeed in Harvest Moon Back to Nature,"The Power Berries
 • PB#1: Pick up your axe and try to cut down the tree on Mother's hill (where there are many flowers). The tree begins to talk! You have the option to keep chopping or stopping. stop chopping. you will get a power berry
 • PB #2: In the mine next to the waterfall, keep mining (with your hoe)and you should encounter a Power berry
 • PB #3: The winter mine (when the lake freezes) also holds a power berry
 • PB #4: Win the Summer Swimming Festival (Tap Triangle and X Alternately as fast as you can. SAVE before attempting!)
 • PB #5: Throw five eggs (One per day) into the waterfall. Stand in the entrance to the mine, aim carefully, and throw. The Harvest Goddess should appear and thank you for your offering. Do this for five days and she will reward you with a Power Berry
 • PB #6: Over the frozen lake, go behind and to the left of the mine. Press X and walk around (against the wall you cannot see) and you will eventually find one
 • PB #7: Purchase every kitchen utensil over the shopping network. The last item should be a power berry for 5000 G.
 • PB #8: In the horse race, you have to win 1001 Medals. You can do this in the beginning by betting on the winning horse, or more simply, care for and train your own horse. Brush your horse everyday and ride him everyday too. When the time comes for the horse race, race with your horse and bet on yourself.
 • PB #9: In the beach (to the left of the Town Square) there is a dock where Greg the Fisherman fishes (you also get the rod from there). Keep fishing in the ocean and you will eventually turn up a power berry.(easiest in winter)
 • PB #10: When you mine in the winter mine, go as deep as you can and eventually there is a cave in the north! In this place, you can start fishing and you will come up with a power berry.
 • Plant 90 flowers, or 10 full fields (any kind, but try not to use the magic red flowers because there is a rare type of flower that appears when you plant many of these). Then, Anna comes to your farm and you can tell her to pick as many as she wants. She gives you a power berry in return, of course.

Special PB: In the spring, grow cucumbers. Put three in your fridge or if you do not have one, put it into your rucksack. When it rains during spring, go up to the lake and stand near the two trees next to each other. Throw one in and this mysterious green creature comes up. Keep throwing them in and he will eventually give you a power berry.

The Beehive: The beehive will produce honey everyday (Including the bottle, somehow.) To get the beehive, plant one field of flowers. When they bloom, bees should gather in your farm. In order to maximize profits, take one bottle to Luis, the bee expert. He will sample your honey and tell you that it is a special type of honey and you can get more money for it.
 • Livestock
 • Wine (to get with Karen): Buy from the winery, but make sure you use the morning part of your day because it is open from 9-12.

 • Spool of approximately 1/8"" wire - Make sure it's one suitable for outdoor use. The length needed will be at least the distance between trees plus three times the height from the winch to the upper pulley. Since this wire often comes in 100' spools, that can handle most needs.

 • 2 or 3 ""S"" hooks - These attach feeders to the wire. Small ones made from approximately 1/8• material are strong enough and big enough. Bigger hooks need bigger cable clamps!
 • 2 eye bolts with a wood or lag screw -  Size is not critical, but something on the order of 1/4• screw and 1"" eye. Get zinc or chrome plated, brass, or stainless steel for outdoor use.
 • Lag bolts, machine screw bolts, washers, and nuts - These are used to mount angle brackets to winch and lag to tree. Zinc or chrome plated, brass, or stainless steel.

Get a Band Interview," • Here is a list of things to never forget during your interview:
 • A recorder, whether it•s your cell phone or a voice recorder. Don•t forget batteries for that recorder.
 • A Sharpie. Bands always need sharpies to sign things and if you have one handy it will give you a conversation starter. Bring one that is metallic. That way, you can see it on whatever they are signing. If you bring a black Sharpie and their CD is black how many people like the signature over the face of the band member?
 • A typed out version of your questions, so you can neatly see them and not have to worry about not being able to read your hand writing.
 • Your original research on the band, read over it just before your interview.
 • A breath mint. There is almost nothing worse than interviewing someone and having to be self conscious about your breath smelling."
